# Xpra HTML Client

This is an (unofficial) clone of the [Xpra HTML5 client](https://xpra.org/trac/browser/xpra/trunk/src/html5/).

It consists of a library and a frontend to connect to remote [Xpra](https://xpra.org/) servers to view X11 sessions inside the browser.

**THIS VERSION IS DEPRECATED**

**THIS IS NOT DONE. SEE [TODO](#todo) LIST BELOW**

The differences here are:

* ES6+
* Bundled
* Refactored
* Non-blocking (whenever possible)
* Separate client module
* Separate frontend example

You can try this yourself at https://andersevenrud.github.io/xpra-html5-client (you need to set up an Xpra server yourself).

## Dependencies

This code is compiled for browser support. Requires Node 8 or later to compile.

*Note:*
* This might not compile on Windows.
* Note, you have set up your own Xpra server to connect to.

### Xpra

To be able to use the Xpra HTML5 features, you need the following dependencies on your host system:

* X11
* pam
* dbus
* alsa
* pulseaudio
* python

## Installation

If you want to run this on your server with a frontend. Clone this repository and perform the following commands:

First set up some dependencies:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd lib/aurora.js
npm install
make browser
```

Then proceed with building:
```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

This will build and start the `example/` application.

Runs by default on http://localhost:9999/

## Usage

If you're using this as a library:

```bash
npm install xpra-html5-client@^1
```

Then in your source:

```javascript
import {createClient} from 'xpra-html5-client';

const client = createClient({/* Configuration */});

client.on('ws:open', () => console.log('Connected!'));

client.connect({
  // This is the same as configuration in createClient()
  // Ex. You can specify your defaults above and pass on any options you want to set in the login form here
  uri: 'ws://localhost:10000'
});
```

See `example/` for an example (which can be served with the installation below).

## Notes

The library is compiled as as UMD, so you can use this directly in the browser using a CDN or loading the `build/` file(s), then use the global `window.XpraHtml5Client` to access the APIs.

To launch an application in Xpra, use this as an example:

```bash
xpra --no-daemon --bind-tcp=127.0.0.1:10000 --start=firefox --html=on start :10
```

*If you want to be able to connect externally use `--bind-tcp=0.0.0.0:10000`*

## Working Features

* Connection
* WebWorker packet handler
* Image decoders (jpeg/png/rgb/rgb32)
* Sound decoders (stream/mediasource/aurora)
* Compression (lz4/zlib)
* Surfaces (window/overlay)
* Mouse input
* Keyboard input
* Sound output
* System bell
* Notification forwarding
* Window handling
* Server console

## TODO

* Fix authentication (not working in main code either)
* Full desktop forwarding
* SSL Support
* Print forwarding
* File forwarding
* Clipboard forwarding
* Window move/resize (incl. server side)
* Finish input support
* Finish platform capability detection
* Experimental video codec renderers
